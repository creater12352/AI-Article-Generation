# 🍴 Welcome to My Food Blog

This is a **Jekyll site** that runs directly from the `main` branch — no extra setup required.  
It’s automatically built and published by **GitHub Pages**.

---

## 🥗 About
This single-file site demonstrates how Jekyll can serve Markdown content directly from your **README.md**.

You can:
- Edit this file to change your homepage
- Add posts later by creating a `_posts` folder (optional)
- Or keep it simple — everything works in this one file!

---

## 🧱 Configuration
If you want to customize it, add a `_config.yml` file later with:
```yaml
title: "My Food Blog"
theme: minima
baseurl: ""
url: "https://YOUR-USERNAME.github.io/YOUR-REPO-NAME"
